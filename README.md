# black-fanfou
A simple design for the Fanfou social network in China.

[Demo](http://anthonyeef.github.io/black-fanfou)

This is more like an exercise for my experimental coding with HTML&CSS. By using Twitter Bootstrap as framework, quikly build a static webpage.

This page is not funtional at all. It's just an idea display. But the responsive feature is fullfilled, which has been tested on my own device.

You are welcome for sending me messages or emails for any advice and comment.
